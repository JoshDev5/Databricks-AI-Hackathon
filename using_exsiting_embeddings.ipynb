He was sentenced after brandishing the piano legs at fans outside his flat in September last year and a few days later telling a woman that he would kill her boyfriend.     The court heard Grube, who has been diagnosed with schizo-affective disorder and narcissistic personality disorder, had been released from Ipswich Hospital on the morning of September 26 after it was decided he did not need further mental health treatment.    On that same morning, a football game was going on at Portman Road stadium and the court heard he got into an altercation with some of the fans and then came out of his house wielding the piano legs.    In mitigation for Grube, solicitor Jeremy Kendall said the 29-year-old had quickly put down the legs when asked by a police officer, however he was then punched in the head by one of the fans.    The police then found cannabis on him after a search.    Two days later, between the 28-29 September, Grube sent a number of messages to a woman he had been friends with for a number of years.     Prosecuting  solicitor Sarah Dawes read out some of the texts to the court which threatened violence toward the woman's boyfriend saying \"he will be shot in the head\".    Another message the  defendant  sent read: “I'm serious I have three licenced guns at home one of which is a shotgun.\"    Further texts then threatened sexual violence towards the woman and that he would \"break her neck\".    Mr Kendall said that Grube had been wrongly and prematurely released from the hospital without any support.    The court also heard from mental health expert Amanda Lee-Pearson who said Grube had not been taking his anti-psychotic medication for the last five months so his mental health had deteriorated.    Suffolk magistrates then sentenced Grube to a total of 13 weeks in jail and ordered to pay £250 to his victim.    He was also issued with a restraining order preventing him from going to her address and the gym she attends.    0 Comments</td><td>https://www.ipswichstar.co.uk/news/24119393.ipswich-man-thom-grube-jailed-13-weeks-violence/</td><td>http://redir.opoint.com/?key=nwY2Th881KUC4JMH2RZC</td><td>0</td><td>en</td><td>GB</td><td>null</td><td>https://www.ipswichstar.co.uk/resources/images/17751507/?type=og-image</td><td>6797280038</td><td>Ipswich Star</td></tr><tr><td>15/02/24 07:07</td><td>World News</td><td>Dubai: fining the owner of the facility of 100 thousand dirhams</td><td>  After finding the facility owner guilty of misusing a declaration of work for an unauthorized purpose, a first-degree court in Dubai fined him 100,000 dirhams.</td><td>The Public Prosecution in Dubai referred the owner of the establishment to the court, for his \"resettlement\", as his company issued a declaration of two read full story</td><td>https://article.wn.com/view/2024/02/15/Dubai_fining_the_owner_of_the_facility_of_100_thousand_dirha/</td><td>http://redir.opoint.com/?key=uVo07FHjQ4kCmGyVCkGB</td><td>0</td><td>en</td><td>US</td><td>null</td><td>null</td><td>6797279678</td><td>World News</td></tr><tr><td>15/02/24 07:07</td><td>WhatsNew2Day</td><td>Beaudesert, Queensland: Woman killed by tractor in ‘possible domestic violence attack'</td><td>  A woman has died after being hit by a tractor in an alleged horrific domestic violence incident.</td><td> Emergency services were called to a property at Woodhill near Beaudesert in southern Queensland shortly after 9am on Thursday.

He defrauded the woman through an international computer-hacking scheme that targeted elderly Americans nationwide and resulted in more than USD 1.2 million in total losses, US Attorney Jesse Laslovich said.    The court ordered on Wednesday that upon release from custody, Vaid would be remanded to the Bureau of Customs and Immigration Enforcement for deportation and ordered Vaid to pay USD 1,236,470  restitution .    “It has become all too common for people outside of our country to victimise Montanans, especially as it relates to wire  fraud , and get away with it. But not this time. Vaid is going to federal prison due to the sophistication and tenacity of the FBI, for which I am grateful,” Laslovich said.    “”Phantom Hacker' scams layer imposter tech support, financial, and government personas to gain access to someone's computer and personal information. Sadly, these scams are increasingly targeting our seniors. Adding to the depravity of this particular case is that the scammer travelled overseas to collect the victim's money in person,” said Special Agent in Charge Shohini Sinha of the Salt Lake City FBI.    Flathead County Sheriff Brian Heino said it is a reminder to all citizens that these scams occur frequently and can be devastating. “I urge everyone to exercise caution; do not allow strangers access to your computer, bank accounts, or personal information,” he said.    In a statement to the court, the Montana victim said, “I feel very violated I have crawled into a shell emotionally and don't want to be vulnerable in any way. I don't know who I can safely trust now. I don't feel safe at all.”    A victim from outside Montana wrote to the court, “I'm driving a 2007 car, and this loss has prevented me from affording a new car. The cost of living keeps going up, which doesn't help when on a fixed income. I'm not sure I will ever have peace of mind again and trust others. This has cost me more than any monetary loss.”    The government alleged in court documents that a large enterprise originating from India was involved in stealing USD 1,236,470 from elderly Americans. The Montana case arose in February 2023, when Glacier Bank notified the FBI that Jane Doe, a 73-year-old woman in Kalispell, had been defrauded.    After learning of the  scam , the FBI set up a ruse in which Jane Doe told the  fraudsters  she still had USD50,000 in cash.    The FBI arrested Vaid, along with his co- defendant , Eddly Joseph, of Gainesville, Florida, when they travelled to Montana to collect the money.    The investigation determined that the  fraudsters  remotely accessed Jane Doe's computer, using UltraViewer, which they installed on her computer.    Joseph was sentenced previously to two years and nine months in prison for his  conviction  in the case, a media release said.</td><td>https://www.takeonedigitalnetwork.com/indian-national-sentenced-to-51-months-in-jail-for-defrauding-elderly-woman-in-us/</td><td>http://redir.opoint.com/?key=US47YF0szGC3sQu3ibMJ</td><td>0</td><td>en</td><td>IN</td><td>null</td><td>https://www.takeonedigitalnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/images-5.jpeg</td><td>6797237986</td><td>Take One Digital Network</td></tr><tr><td>15/02/24 07:07</td><td>Verified News Explorer Network</td><td>Joel Klatt Evaluates The Implications Of Ryan Grubb's Departure From Alabama</td><td>  usatsi_22181978  Former Alabama offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb recently took a job to become the offensive coordinator for the Seattle Seahawks in the NFL.</td><td>Grubb has had a very interesting last month with rumors swirling about his next job daily. After Kalen Deboer departed Washington for Alabama, many thought Grubb would replace Deboer as head coach at Washington, but he did not end up getting that role and followed Deboer down to Alabama just to eventually head back to Seattle but this time for the NFL.    College football analyst Joel Klatt broke down Grubb's recent actions and what it means for Deboer and the state of Alabama football.    “The carousel is also spinning at Alabama,” Klatt said on his podcast. “So Alabama hires Kalen DeBoer, he brought his coordinator Ryan Grubb, who wanted to head job with the Huskies but didn't get it. So he brought him down to Alabama but then Grubb immediately starts looking around and he gets the Seahawks offensive coordinator position … He's also taking his o-line coach Scott Huff to Seattle.    “So the question that I asked myself is how big of a deal is this for Kalen DeBoer? Not that serious, because in my mind, that would be like Ryan Day losing a coordinator, like Steve Sarkisian losing a coordinator, like Lincoln Riley losing a coordinator. This is Kalen DeBoer's  offense . Grubb was excellent. There's no doubt … But he was doing that under the umbrella of Kalen DeBoer's  offense .”    Klatt believes With DeBoer taking the reins after Grubb's departure, Alabama fans need not be concerned.    “So if I'm an Alabama fan, that gives me some not just hope but it kind of calms my anxiety about this,” Klatt said. “They always knew that this was going to be a possibility, even when DeBoer took the job and brought Ryan Grubb in. So they knew that this was a possibility …    “This is now outside of the window of when they lost Nick Saban and hired Kalen DeBoer, which means that their internal transfer window is closed. The OC job will likely be a co-OC situation. Nick Sheridan, who's been with DeBoer before, Jamarcus Shepard. They both came with DeBoer to Alabama from Washington. Sheridan is considered probably more in that play caller vein.”</td><td>https://vnexplorer.net/joel-klatt-evaluates-the-implications-of-ryan-grubbs-departure-from-alabama-s1527382.html</td><td>http://redir.opoint.com/?key=fCKn47kZRbr8hk481qvK</td><td>0</td><td>en</td><td>VN</td><td>null</td><td>https://img-s-msn-com.akamaized.net/tenant/amp/entityid/AA1mplfn.img</td><td>6797279194</td><td>Verified News Explorer Network</td></tr><tr><td>15/02/24 07:07</td><td>Verified News Explorer Network</td><td>Pfizer agrees to pay $93 million to settle Lipitor antitrust lawsuit</td><td>  FILE PHOTO: A person walks past the Pfizer building in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., March 2, 2021. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File Photo</td><td> By Mike Scarcella    (Reuters) – Pfizer has agreed to pay $93 million to settle antitrust claims by wholesale drug distributors that accused it of conspiring with India's Ranbaxy Laboratories to delay sales of less expensive, generic versions of the cholesterol drug Lipitor.    Attorneys for Lipitor purchasers including Rochester Drug Co-Operative Inc and Puerto Rico's Drogueria Betances LLC disclosed the agreement in a filing on Wednesday in U.S. court in Trenton, New Jersey.    The distributors' case will continue against Ranbaxy, the attorneys filing said.    The proposed settlement, which requires a judge's approval, comes after more than a decade of litigation. Pfizer did not admit liability.    Pfizer in a statement called the allegations “factually and legally without merit.” It said the settlement was “fair, reasonable and the best way to resolve this litigation.”    A representative for Sun Pharma, which acquired Ranbaxy in 2014, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.    Pfizer introduced Lipitor in 1997, and the drug drove more than $130 billion in sales during its first 14 years on the market.    The pharma distributors claimed Pfizer  fraudulently  sought to extend its patent rights over Lipitor. They accused the company of paying Ranbaxy to delay introducing a generic version of Lipitor and engaging in sham litigation with Ranbaxy over the drug.    Lawyers for the plaintiffs said the settlement provides “immediate economic relief” to class members and avoids the risk of continued litigation, potential appeals and no recovery. They said they will seek up to about $31 million in  legal fees  from the settlement fund.    The case is In re: Lipitor Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey, No. 3:12-cv-02389-PGS-JBD.

The families submitted a more than 1,000-page brief, which includes testimony from some of the hostages who have already been released. It supports “allegations of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes,” including “the taking of hostages, killings and acts of sexual violence,” according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, a support group for the families that is representing them at the court.    The ICC's chief  prosecutor , Karim Khan, is investigating alleged crimes committed by both Hamas and Israel. The families, who are giving testimony over the course of months, are presenting evidence that they hope will get Khan to file an  indictment  that leads to arrest warrants for Hamas leaders.    “What the families are bringing is as much assistance as possible to enable the court to do their job,” said Yuval Sasson, a lawyer representing the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.    ICC warrants prompt the police organization Interpol to seek assistance from law-enforcement agencies worldwide to locate and arrest wanted individuals, but the chances of arrest can be slim in some cases. The court issued an arrest warrant last year for Russian President Vladimir Putin, but Russian officials dismissed the  charges , saying the country isn't a party to the ICC.    The motivation of the families in bringing the allegations to the court goes beyond the potential arrest warrants. Public advocacy is one of the few avenues families have to affect the fate of their loved ones.    Families are increasingly anxious about the survival of the remaining hostages. Talks over a cease-fire deal that would secure the release of the remaining hostages hit a fresh setback Wednesday, as Israel said it wouldn't send a delegation to Cairo to continue negotiations.    The families said they plan to barricade the entrance of the Israeli military headquarters until the prime minister and security cabinet meet with them.    Shelly Aviv Yeini, who leads the legal team at the Hostages and Missing Families Forum that prepared the brief, said the submission at The Hague serves various aims for the families. A long-term goal is achieving justice, while a short-term objective is to add to pressure on governments to release the hostages, she said.    While it is uncertain whether Khan will bring an  indictment  that leads to arrests of Hamas members, the families said the warrants themselves, if issued, would serve the purpose of labeling them as war criminals. “I think it has a lot of damage to their image,” said Yeini. “It will limit [Hamas's] actions, I hope.”    The forum said it hasn't made its brief public or revealed the names of people giving testimony to the ICC for their protection.    Amit Shem Tov's brother, Omer Shem Tov, was kidnapped at a music festival in southern Israel on Oct. 7 and is one of 130 hostages who remain in captivity. Two Israeli hostages who were released told Omer's family that he was alive and not injured.    Amit Shem Tov has traveled the world, including the U.S. and Europe, to raise awareness about his brother and other hostages. He didn't give testimony as a part of the brief for the ICC but said he felt it was important to show up the week it was being submitted.    After a more than four-hour flight, families boarded buses to drive for an hour in the rain to the ICC. A few hundred yards from where the court is based, they gathered at an outdoor performance stage that the Hostages and Missing Families Forum had set up to hold a rally. Taking cover under umbrellas and waving Israeli flags, they chanted, “Bring them home now.”    One of the speakers was Itay Regev, 18, who was a good friend of Omer Shem Tov and spent 54 days with him in captivity before being released in November. Itay's account of Oct. 7 and his time in captivity was included in the brief submitted to the ICC.    “The least I can do is to speak in their name,” he said of the remaining hostages, including Omer. “Every second of the day is important.”    Amit and Dana walked around with posters of Omer, the youngest of the three. The journey to The Hague was Dana's fifth international trip. They were trying to carry the baton as their parents continued to rally back in Israel. “We try to keep our spirits up by taking a stand and not just waiting for things to happen,” said Dana.    The family learned from Regev that he and Omer were held above ground and kept track of time by writing in a notebook. They fantasized about what they wanted to do once released. Omer dreamed of traveling the world and becoming a music producer. Amit said he wished he could show his brother places abroad such as the Netherlands one day.    After hours standing outside near the ICC, the families gathered for dinner at a Jewish community center in Amsterdam, where the chief rabbi of the city welcomed them. On a reception table were piles of photo albums of the hostages with expressions of good will written by supporters.    Through months of advocacy and traveling the world together to meet international leaders, hostage families have become close. One of the released hostages, Agam Goldstein-Almog, 17, sat with family members of other hostages at dinner. “I love you. Next time I see you it will be with a smile,” she told one relative of a hostage as they hugged and parted.

The alleged victims are seeking unspecified damages in an amount to be determined at trial. The lawsuit also says they support the unredacted release of FBI documents regarding Epstein, claiming the files are still largely sealed.    “The filing of this lawsuit is the first step to getting to the bottom of what we have recently learned – that for years the FBI negligently failed to act on clear evidence that Jeffrey Epstein was operating a vast sex abuse operation and sex trafficking ring, as alleged,” Jennifer Plotkin and Nathan Werksman, attorneys for the Jane Does, said in a written statement. “That failure resulted in incalculable harm to our clients.”    Epstein, a  convicted  pedophile, died in jail before he could face trial on federal sex-trafficking  charges .    When reached for comment, the FBI said it does not comment on litigation. CNN has reached out to the Department of Justice for comment.    FBI failed to investigate complaints and tips about Epstein, lawsuit claims    An individual told the FBI in 1996 that Epstein and his companion Ghislaine Maxwell had sexually abused her and there were other victims, according to the lawsuit. The FBI “hung up” on her and did not investigate the report, the lawsuit claims.    “Between 1996 and 2005, the FBI continued to receive direct reports, complaints and tips concerning the  illegal  sex trafficking of women and underage minors, sex abuse and human rights violations committed by Jeffrey Epstein and associates,” the lawsuit said. “In response, the FBI failed to act upon and investigate the complaints and tips and failed to comply with protocol and guidelines notwithstanding credible reports of solicitation of child prostitution and sex trafficking.”    The FBI also failed to investigate or conduct appropriate background checks when Epstein's office worked to obtain travel documents for women and girls, the lawsuit claims.    In March 2005, the Palm Beach Police Department in Florida received a report that an underage girl was brought to Epstein's residence for a sexual massage, according to the lawsuit. The police sent information to the FBI that same month, but the agency did not open a case until the summer of 2006, the lawsuit alleges.    “During the FBI investigation, the FBI was complicit in permitting Epstein and coconspirators to continue to victimize Jane Does 1-12 and other young women,” the lawsuit said. “The FBI had photographs, videos and interviews and hard evidence of child prostitution and failed to timely investigate and arrest Epstein in deviation from the FBI protocols.”    Between 2006 and 2008, JP Morgan Chase contacted the federal government on “numerous occasions” regarding Epstein's transactions and concern about child prostitution, according to the lawsuit. The FBI was notified the bank handled more than $1.1 million in payments from Epstein to women or girls, the lawsuit claimed.    “The FBI was aware of the hard cash flowing out of Epstein's accounts in transactions related to human trafficking yet concealed the reports and did not investigate the crimes until the recent lawsuit filed by the U.S. Virgin Islands against JP Morgan Chase,” the lawsuit said.    Last year, JP Morgan Chase reached a settlement in that case, which included “significant commitments” to curtail human trafficking and a $75 million payment to the US Virgin Islands.    JP Morgan said in a statement at the time it was not conceding any liability in the settlement, reiterating it “deeply regrets any association” with Epstein.    In 2008, Epstein was arrested and served 13 months in prison after pleading guilty to two state prostitution  charges . He also registered as a sex offender and paid  restitution  to the victims identified by the FBI.    “The FBI delayed, procrastinated and waited three years to arrest Epstein for child prostitution all the while Epstein's sex trafficking operation continued to operate as underage girls and young women were sexually abused such as the Plaintiffs herein,” the lawsuit said.    FBI records show the agency's investigation was closed in September 2008, according to the lawsuit.    However, the FBI allegedly received additional tips and reports concerning sex abuse following the 2008  plea deal . The lawsuit claimed the agency was aware Epstein's sex-trafficking ring continued to operate after he was a registered sex offender.    “From 2009 until 2019, the FBI was complicit in permitting the ongoing sex trafficking of minors, rape and sexual abuse of girls and young women which occurred between New York, Palm Beach and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and many other locations,” the lawsuit said.    In 2019, 11 years after the  plea deal , Epstein was indicted on federal  charges  of operating a sex-trafficking ring in which he allegedly sexually abused dozens of underage girls. He died by suicide in jail while awaiting trial.

But Walli Carranza said nothing came of her actions.</td><td> Carranza said she believes systemic failures as well as lax gun laws ultimately led to Sunday's shooting at celebrity pastor Joel Osteen's Lakewood Church in which Genesse Moreno entered the church with her 7-year-old son and opened fire in a hallway. Two people were wounded in the shooting, including Moreno's son, who was shot in the head. Moreno was gunned down by security officers she exchanged gunfire with.    “You can't put responsibility on the mind, when the mind was so very ill. A healthy mother would never bring her child to a situation like this. That's not mental health. So sometimes we don't have to find a guilty party or place blame. We can just say there are systems that failed,” Carranza told The Associated Press in an interview.    Carranza said her grandson Samuel remained in critical condition, but that he was doing better.    Various questions about the shooting remained unanswered on Wednesday, including Moreno's motive and details about how she obtained the AR-style rifle she used.    Carranza said her son Enrique Carranza and Moreno met at the University of Houston and married in September 2015. They divorced in 2022.    Carranza said her son, who is currently incarcerated in Florida, didn't want to divorce Moreno and only “wanted his wife to get healthy.”    Carranza said Child Protective Services was notified after Moreno was accused by nurses of putting adult medication in her son's feeding tube after his birth in 2016. Other concerns, including allegations that Moreno left guns unattended in her home, were also forwarded to CPS but no action was taken, Carranza said.    “My great concern for Sam was that he was going to shoot himself, and that's what we warned against,” Carranza said. She added that in January 2020, when Moreno and her grandson visited her in Colorado, Samuel pulled a handgun from his diaper bag and gave it to her.    Melissa Landford, spokesperson for the state Department of Family and Protective Services, said CPS could not comment on the case for confidentiality reasons.    Carranza also said that in 2020 and 2021, her attorney sent emails to Lakewood Church asking for assistance with intervening in Moreno's struggles, believing that Moreno's mother attended the church.    Church spokesman Don Iloff said Wednesday that records show Moreno “sporadically” attended services at Lakewood for a couple years but there were no records of her being at the church after 2022.    Iloff said they were still looking but had not found any records showing Moreno's mother attended the church. He added that church officials also had not found records of the emails sent by Carranza's attorney but they were still looking.    Iloff said in situations where someone may reach out for help, what the church can offer them is spiritual and biblical counseling.    “If we had reached out and (Moreno) had accepted counseling, then we definitely would have been more than happy to provide that,” Iloff said.    In a video message on Instagram, Osteen invited people to attend a special service at the church this coming Sunday to celebrate a “time of healing and restoration.”    “We are not people of fear. We are people of faith. God has us in the palm of his hand, and this is not the time to shrink back. This is the time to turn to God, to rally together,” Osteen said.    Texas law generally bans someone  convicted  of a felony from owning a gun for several years after they are released from prison. Misdemeanors connected to domestic violence will also trigger a ban.    But Moreno's extensive list of misdemeanors, ranging from forging a $100 bill to shoplifting and assault, did not meet that threshold.    Texas also lacks a so-called “red flag” law, which generally allows law enforcement or family members to ask a judge to order the seizure or surrender of guns from someone who is deemed dangerous, often because of mental health concerns or threats of violence.    Carranza said she met for hours with FBI agents on Tuesday, discussing the reports she filed over the years about Moreno.    ___    Associated Press writer Jim Vertuno in Austin contributed to this report.    ___    Follow Juan A.

         "Ipswich man Thom Grube jailed for 13 weeks for violence",
         "An Ipswich man who threatened football fans with piano legs and days later sent “extremely threatening messages” to a woman has been jailed for thirteen weeks.",
         " Before Suffolk Magistrates' Court on Wednesday, February 14, was Thom Grube, 29, of Portman Road who had admitted possessing an offensive weapon in a public place, failure to surrender to bail at the appointed time, possession of cannabis, harassment and sending offensive messages.    He was sentenced after brandishing the piano legs at fans outside his flat in September last year and a few days later telling a woman that he would kill her boyfriend.     The court heard Grube, who has been diagnosed with schizo-affective disorder and narcissistic personality disorder, had been released from Ipswich Hospital on the morning of September 26 after it was decided he did not need further mental health treatment.    On that same morning, a football game was going on at Portman Road stadium and the court heard he got into an altercation with some of the fans and then came out of his house wielding the piano legs.    In mitigation for Grube, solicitor Jeremy Kendall said the 29-year-old had quickly put down the legs when asked by a police officer, however he was then punched in the head by one of the fans.    The police then found cannabis on him after a search.    Two days later, between the 28-29 September, Grube sent a number of messages to a woman he had been friends with for a number of years.     Prosecuting  solicitor Sarah Dawes read out some of the texts to the court which threatened violence toward the woman's boyfriend saying \"he will be shot in the head\".    Another message the  defendant  sent read: “I'm serious I have three licenced guns at home one of which is a shotgun.\"    Further texts then threatened sexual violence towards the woman and that he would \"break her neck\".    Mr Kendall said that Grube had been wrongly and prematurely released from the hospital without any support.    The court also heard from mental health expert Amanda Lee-Pearson who said Grube had not been taking his anti-psychotic medication for the last five months so his mental health had deteriorated.    Suffolk magistrates then sentenced Grube to a total of 13 weeks in jail and ordered to pay £250 to his victim.    He was also issued with a restraining order preventing him from going to her address and the gym she attends.    0 Comments",

         "Indian national sentenced to 51 months in jail for defrauding elderly woman in US",
         "Washington, Feb 15 (PTI) A 24-year-old Indian national has been sentenced by a US court to 51 months in jail for defrauding an elderly American woman of USD 150,000 through a computer-hacking scheme, a US attorney said.",
         " The  defendant , Sukhdev Vaid of Haryana, pleaded guilty in December 2023 to wire  fraud .    He defrauded the woman through an international computer-hacking scheme that targeted elderly Americans nationwide and resulted in more than USD 1.2 million in total losses, US Attorney Jesse Laslovich said.    The court ordered on Wednesday that upon release from custody, Vaid would be remanded to the Bureau of Customs and Immigration Enforcement for deportation and ordered Vaid to pay USD 1,236,470  restitution .    “It has become all too common for people outside of our country to victimise Montanans, especially as it relates to wire  fraud , and get away with it. But not this time. Vaid is going to federal prison due to the sophistication and tenacity of the FBI, for which I am grateful,” Laslovich said.    “”Phantom Hacker' scams layer imposter tech support, financial, and government personas to gain access to someone's computer and personal information. Sadly, these scams are increasingly targeting our seniors. Adding to the depravity of this particular case is that the scammer travelled overseas to collect the victim's money in person,” said Special Agent in Charge Shohini Sinha of the Salt Lake City FBI.    Flathead County Sheriff Brian Heino said it is a reminder to all citizens that these scams occur frequently and can be devastating. “I urge everyone to exercise caution; do not allow strangers access to your computer, bank accounts, or personal information,” he said.    In a statement to the court, the Montana victim said, “I feel very violated I have crawled into a shell emotionally and don't want to be vulnerable in any way. I don't know who I can safely trust now. I don't feel safe at all.”    A victim from outside Montana wrote to the court, “I'm driving a 2007 car, and this loss has prevented me from affording a new car. The cost of living keeps going up, which doesn't help when on a fixed income. I'm not sure I will ever have peace of mind again and trust others. This has cost me more than any monetary loss.”    The government alleged in court documents that a large enterprise originating from India was involved in stealing USD 1,236,470 from elderly Americans. The Montana case arose in February 2023, when Glacier Bank notified the FBI that Jane Doe, a 73-year-old woman in Kalispell, had been defrauded.    After learning of the  scam , the FBI set up a ruse in which Jane Doe told the  fraudsters  she still had USD50,000 in cash.    The FBI arrested Vaid, along with his co- defendant , Eddly Joseph, of Gainesville, Florida, when they travelled to Montana to collect the money.    The investigation determined that the  fraudsters  remotely accessed Jane Doe's computer, using UltraViewer, which they installed on her computer.    Joseph was sentenced previously to two years and nine months in prison for his  conviction  in the case, a media release said.",

         "  usatsi_22181978  Former Alabama offensive coordinator Ryan Grubb recently took a job to become the offensive coordinator for the Seattle Seahawks in the NFL.",
         "Grubb has had a very interesting last month with rumors swirling about his next job daily. After Kalen Deboer departed Washington for Alabama, many thought Grubb would replace Deboer as head coach at Washington, but he did not end up getting that role and followed Deboer down to Alabama just to eventually head back to Seattle but this time for the NFL.    College football analyst Joel Klatt broke down Grubb's recent actions and what it means for Deboer and the state of Alabama football.    “The carousel is also spinning at Alabama,” Klatt said on his podcast. “So Alabama hires Kalen DeBoer, he brought his coordinator Ryan Grubb, who wanted to head job with the Huskies but didn't get it. So he brought him down to Alabama but then Grubb immediately starts looking around and he gets the Seahawks offensive coordinator position … He's also taking his o-line coach Scott Huff to Seattle.    “So the question that I asked myself is how big of a deal is this for Kalen DeBoer? Not that serious, because in my mind, that would be like Ryan Day losing a coordinator, like Steve Sarkisian losing a coordinator, like Lincoln Riley losing a coordinator. This is Kalen DeBoer's  offense . Grubb was excellent. There's no doubt … But he was doing that under the umbrella of Kalen DeBoer's  offense .”    Klatt believes With DeBoer taking the reins after Grubb's departure, Alabama fans need not be concerned.    “So if I'm an Alabama fan, that gives me some not just hope but it kind of calms my anxiety about this,” Klatt said. “They always knew that this was going to be a possibility, even when DeBoer took the job and brought Ryan Grubb in. So they knew that this was a possibility …    “This is now outside of the window of when they lost Nick Saban and hired Kalen DeBoer, which means that their internal transfer window is closed. The OC job will likely be a co-OC situation. Nick Sheridan, who's been with DeBoer before, Jamarcus Shepard. They both came with DeBoer to Alabama from Washington. Sheridan is considered probably more in that play caller vein.”",

         "  FILE PHOTO: A person walks past the Pfizer building in Manhattan, New York City, U.S., March 2, 2021. REUTERS/Carlo Allegri/File Photo",
         " By Mike Scarcella    (Reuters) – Pfizer has agreed to pay $93 million to settle antitrust claims by wholesale drug distributors that accused it of conspiring with India's Ranbaxy Laboratories to delay sales of less expensive, generic versions of the cholesterol drug Lipitor.    Attorneys for Lipitor purchasers including Rochester Drug Co-Operative Inc and Puerto Rico's Drogueria Betances LLC disclosed the agreement in a filing on Wednesday in U.S. court in Trenton, New Jersey.    The distributors' case will continue against Ranbaxy, the attorneys filing said.    The proposed settlement, which requires a judge's approval, comes after more than a decade of litigation. Pfizer did not admit liability.    Pfizer in a statement called the allegations “factually and legally without merit.” It said the settlement was “fair, reasonable and the best way to resolve this litigation.”    A representative for Sun Pharma, which acquired Ranbaxy in 2014, did not immediately respond to a request for comment.    Pfizer introduced Lipitor in 1997, and the drug drove more than $130 billion in sales during its first 14 years on the market.    The pharma distributors claimed Pfizer  fraudulently  sought to extend its patent rights over Lipitor. They accused the company of paying Ranbaxy to delay introducing a generic version of Lipitor and engaging in sham litigation with Ranbaxy over the drug.    Lawyers for the plaintiffs said the settlement provides “immediate economic relief” to class members and avoids the risk of continued litigation, potential appeals and no recovery. They said they will seek up to about $31 million in  legal fees  from the settlement fund.    The case is In re: Lipitor Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, District of New Jersey, No. 3:12-cv-02389-PGS-JBD.    (Reporting by Mike Scarcella; Editing by Christopher Cushing)",

         "  THE HAGUE—When Amit Shem Tov woke up at 4 a.m. Wednesday to board a flight to The Hague with his sister, it had been 131 days since their brother had been taken hostage.",
         " “Just because it's been so long, doesn't mean we stop fighting,” said the 24-year-old barista, who has given up his job to bring worldwide attention to the plight of the hostages. “To the contrary, we're working harder.”    Shem Tov and his sister, Dana, were among dozens of families and released hostages who traveled to The Hague on Wednesday to raise awareness about the hostages and help submit allegations of war crimes against Hamas to the International  Criminal  Court.    The families submitted a more than 1,000-page brief, which includes testimony from some of the hostages who have already been released. It supports “allegations of genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes,” including “the taking of hostages, killings and acts of sexual violence,” according to the Hostages and Missing Families Forum, a support group for the families that is representing them at the court.    The ICC's chief  prosecutor , Karim Khan, is investigating alleged crimes committed by both Hamas and Israel. The families, who are giving testimony over the course of months, are presenting evidence that they hope will get Khan to file an  indictment  that leads to arrest warrants for Hamas leaders.    “What the families are bringing is as much assistance as possible to enable the court to do their job,” said Yuval Sasson, a lawyer representing the Hostages and Missing Families Forum.    ICC warrants prompt the police organization Interpol to seek assistance from law-enforcement agencies worldwide to locate and arrest wanted individuals, but the chances of arrest can be slim in some cases. The court issued an arrest warrant last year for Russian President Vladimir Putin, but Russian officials dismissed the  charges , saying the country isn't a party to the ICC.    The motivation of the families in bringing the allegations to the court goes beyond the potential arrest warrants. Public advocacy is one of the few avenues families have to affect the fate of their loved ones.    Families are increasingly anxious about the survival of the remaining hostages. Talks over a cease-fire deal that would secure the release of the remaining hostages hit a fresh setback Wednesday, as Israel said it wouldn't send a delegation to Cairo to continue negotiations.    The families said they plan to barricade the entrance of the Israeli military headquarters until the prime minister and security cabinet meet with them.    Shelly Aviv Yeini, who leads the legal team at the Hostages and Missing Families Forum that prepared the brief, said the submission at The Hague serves various aims for the families. A long-term goal is achieving justice, while a short-term objective is to add to pressure on governments to release the hostages, she said.    While it is uncertain whether Khan will bring an  indictment  that leads to arrests of Hamas members, the families said the warrants themselves, if issued, would serve the purpose of labeling them as war criminals. “I think it has a lot of damage to their image,” said Yeini. “It will limit [Hamas's] actions, I hope.”    The forum said it hasn't made its brief public or revealed the names of people giving testimony to the ICC for their protection.    Amit Shem Tov's brother, Omer Shem Tov, was kidnapped at a music festival in southern Israel on Oct. 7 and is one of 130 hostages who remain in captivity. Two Israeli hostages who were released told Omer's family that he was alive and not injured.    Amit Shem Tov has traveled the world, including the U.S. and Europe, to raise awareness about his brother and other hostages. He didn't give testimony as a part of the brief for the ICC but said he felt it was important to show up the week it was being submitted.    After a more than four-hour flight, families boarded buses to drive for an hour in the rain to the ICC. A few hundred yards from where the court is based, they gathered at an outdoor performance stage that the Hostages and Missing Families Forum had set up to hold a rally. Taking cover under umbrellas and waving Israeli flags, they chanted, “Bring them home now.”    One of the speakers was Itay Regev, 18, who was a good friend of Omer Shem Tov and spent 54 days with him in captivity before being released in November. Itay's account of Oct. 7 and his time in captivity was included in the brief submitted to the ICC.    “The least I can do is to speak in their name,” he said of the remaining hostages, including Omer. “Every second of the day is important.”    Amit and Dana walked around with posters of Omer, the youngest of the three. The journey to The Hague was Dana's fifth international trip. They were trying to carry the baton as their parents continued to rally back in Israel. “We try to keep our spirits up by taking a stand and not just waiting for things to happen,” said Dana.    The family learned from Regev that he and Omer were held above ground and kept track of time by writing in a notebook. They fantasized about what they wanted to do once released. Omer dreamed of traveling the world and becoming a music producer. Amit said he wished he could show his brother places abroad such as the Netherlands one day.    After hours standing outside near the ICC, the families gathered for dinner at a Jewish community center in Amsterdam, where the chief rabbi of the city welcomed them. On a reception table were piles of photo albums of the hostages with expressions of good will written by supporters.    Through months of advocacy and traveling the world together to meet international leaders, hostage families have become close. One of the released hostages, Agam Goldstein-Almog, 17, sat with family members of other hostages at dinner. “I love you. Next time I see you it will be with a smile,” she told one relative of a hostage as they hugged and parted.    Write to Chao Deng at chao.deng@wsj.com",

         "12 women sue FBI over alleged failure to protect them from Jeffrey Epstein's sexual abuse",
         "  The FBI's “repeated and continued failures, delays and inaction” allowed Jeffrey Epstein to continue his sex trafficking operation for more than 20 years, 12 alleged victims claimed in a lawsuit filed Wednesday.",
         " The suit, filed against the United States in the Southern District of New York, claims the FBI's negligence resulted in the continued sexual abuse of the 12 alleged victims, who are not named in the lawsuit.    “For over two decades, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (hereinafter ‘FBI') permitted Jeffrey Epstein to sex traffic and sexually abuse scores of children and young women by failing to do the job the American people expected of it and that the FBI's own rules and regulations required: investigate the reports, tips, and evidence it had of rampant sexual abuse and sex trafficking by Epstein and protect the young women and children who fell victim to him,” the lawsuit reads.    The alleged victims are seeking unspecified damages in an amount to be determined at trial. The lawsuit also says they support the unredacted release of FBI documents regarding Epstein, claiming the files are still largely sealed.    “The filing of this lawsuit is the first step to getting to the bottom of what we have recently learned – that for years the FBI negligently failed to act on clear evidence that Jeffrey Epstein was operating a vast sex abuse operation and sex trafficking ring, as alleged,” Jennifer Plotkin and Nathan Werksman, attorneys for the Jane Does, said in a written statement. “That failure resulted in incalculable harm to our clients.”    Epstein, a  convicted  pedophile, died in jail before he could face trial on federal sex-trafficking  charges .    When reached for comment, the FBI said it does not comment on litigation. CNN has reached out to the Department of Justice for comment.    FBI failed to investigate complaints and tips about Epstein, lawsuit claims    An individual told the FBI in 1996 that Epstein and his companion Ghislaine Maxwell had sexually abused her and there were other victims, according to the lawsuit. The FBI “hung up” on her and did not investigate the report, the lawsuit claims.    “Between 1996 and 2005, the FBI continued to receive direct reports, complaints and tips concerning the  illegal  sex trafficking of women and underage minors, sex abuse and human rights violations committed by Jeffrey Epstein and associates,” the lawsuit said. “In response, the FBI failed to act upon and investigate the complaints and tips and failed to comply with protocol and guidelines notwithstanding credible reports of solicitation of child prostitution and sex trafficking.”    The FBI also failed to investigate or conduct appropriate background checks when Epstein's office worked to obtain travel documents for women and girls, the lawsuit claims.    In March 2005, the Palm Beach Police Department in Florida received a report that an underage girl was brought to Epstein's residence for a sexual massage, according to the lawsuit. The police sent information to the FBI that same month, but the agency did not open a case until the summer of 2006, the lawsuit alleges.    “During the FBI investigation, the FBI was complicit in permitting Epstein and coconspirators to continue to victimize Jane Does 1-12 and other young women,” the lawsuit said. “The FBI had photographs, videos and interviews and hard evidence of child prostitution and failed to timely investigate and arrest Epstein in deviation from the FBI protocols.”    Between 2006 and 2008, JP Morgan Chase contacted the federal government on “numerous occasions” regarding Epstein's transactions and concern about child prostitution, according to the lawsuit. The FBI was notified the bank handled more than $1.1 million in payments from Epstein to women or girls, the lawsuit claimed.    “The FBI was aware of the hard cash flowing out of Epstein's accounts in transactions related to human trafficking yet concealed the reports and did not investigate the crimes until the recent lawsuit filed by the U.S. Virgin Islands against JP Morgan Chase,” the lawsuit said.    Last year, JP Morgan Chase reached a settlement in that case, which included “significant commitments” to curtail human trafficking and a $75 million payment to the US Virgin Islands.    JP Morgan said in a statement at the time it was not conceding any liability in the settlement, reiterating it “deeply regrets any association” with Epstein.    In 2008, Epstein was arrested and served 13 months in prison after pleading guilty to two state prostitution  charges . He also registered as a sex offender and paid  restitution  to the victims identified by the FBI.    “The FBI delayed, procrastinated and waited three years to arrest Epstein for child prostitution all the while Epstein's sex trafficking operation continued to operate as underage girls and young women were sexually abused such as the Plaintiffs herein,” the lawsuit said.    FBI records show the agency's investigation was closed in September 2008, according to the lawsuit.    However, the FBI allegedly received additional tips and reports concerning sex abuse following the 2008  plea deal . The lawsuit claimed the agency was aware Epstein's sex-trafficking ring continued to operate after he was a registered sex offender.    “From 2009 until 2019, the FBI was complicit in permitting the ongoing sex trafficking of minors, rape and sexual abuse of girls and young women which occurred between New York, Palm Beach and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and many other locations,” the lawsuit said.    In 2019, 11 years after the  plea deal , Epstein was indicted on federal  charges  of operating a sex-trafficking ring in which he allegedly sexually abused dozens of underage girls. He died by suicide in jail while awaiting trial.    For more CNN news and newsletters create an account at CNN.com",

         "Warning signs mounted before Texas shooter entered church with her son, former mother-in-law says",
         "HOUSTON (AP) — The former mother-in-law of the woman who opened fire at a Houston megachurch tried for years to alert authorities and others, including church staff, about her ex-daughter-in-law's mental health struggles, she said Wednesday. But Walli Carranza said nothing came of her actions.",
         " Carranza said she believes systemic failures as well as lax gun laws ultimately led to Sunday's shooting at celebrity pastor Joel Osteen's Lakewood Church in which Genesse Moreno entered the church with her 7-year-old son and opened fire in a hallway. Two people were wounded in the shooting, including Moreno's son, who was shot in the head. Moreno was gunned down by security officers she exchanged gunfire with.    “You can't put responsibility on the mind, when the mind was so very ill. A healthy mother would never bring her child to a situation like this. That's not mental health. So sometimes we don't have to find a guilty party or place blame. We can just say there are systems that failed,” Carranza told The Associated Press in an interview.    Carranza said her grandson Samuel remained in critical condition, but that he was doing better.    Various questions about the shooting remained unanswered on Wednesday, including Moreno's motive and details about how she obtained the AR-style rifle she used.    Carranza said her son Enrique Carranza and Moreno met at the University of Houston and married in September 2015. They divorced in 2022.    Carranza said her son, who is currently incarcerated in Florida, didn't want to divorce Moreno and only “wanted his wife to get healthy.”    Carranza said Child Protective Services was notified after Moreno was accused by nurses of putting adult medication in her son's feeding tube after his birth in 2016. Other concerns, including allegations that Moreno left guns unattended in her home, were also forwarded to CPS but no action was taken, Carranza said.    “My great concern for Sam was that he was going to shoot himself, and that's what we warned against,” Carranza said. She added that in January 2020, when Moreno and her grandson visited her in Colorado, Samuel pulled a handgun from his diaper bag and gave it to her.    Melissa Landford, spokesperson for the state Department of Family and Protective Services, said CPS could not comment on the case for confidentiality reasons.    Carranza also said that in 2020 and 2021, her attorney sent emails to Lakewood Church asking for assistance with intervening in Moreno's struggles, believing that Moreno's mother attended the church.    Church spokesman Don Iloff said Wednesday that records show Moreno “sporadically” attended services at Lakewood for a couple years but there were no records of her being at the church after 2022.    Iloff said they were still looking but had not found any records showing Moreno's mother attended the church. He added that church officials also had not found records of the emails sent by Carranza's attorney but they were still looking.    Iloff said in situations where someone may reach out for help, what the church can offer them is spiritual and biblical counseling.    “If we had reached out and (Moreno) had accepted counseling, then we definitely would have been more than happy to provide that,” Iloff said.    In a video message on Instagram, Osteen invited people to attend a special service at the church this coming Sunday to celebrate a “time of healing and restoration.”    “We are not people of fear. We are people of faith. God has us in the palm of his hand, and this is not the time to shrink back. This is the time to turn to God, to rally together,” Osteen said.    Texas law generally bans someone  convicted  of a felony from owning a gun for several years after they are released from prison. Misdemeanors connected to domestic violence will also trigger a ban.    But Moreno's extensive list of misdemeanors, ranging from forging a $100 bill to shoplifting and assault, did not meet that threshold.    Texas also lacks a so-called “red flag” law, which generally allows law enforcement or family members to ask a judge to order the seizure or surrender of guns from someone who is deemed dangerous, often because of mental health concerns or threats of violence.    Carranza said she met for hours with FBI agents on Tuesday, discussing the reports she filed over the years about Moreno.    ___    Associated Press writer Jim Vertuno in Austin contributed to this report.    ___    Follow Juan A.
